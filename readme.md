## Binary Conversion

This program allows you to convert numbers between binary and decimal representations. It provides two conversion options: binary to decimal ('bd') and decimal to binary ('db').

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Run the code using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE).
2. The program will display a menu asking for the desired operation.
3. Enter 'bd' if you want to convert binary to decimal, or 'db' if you want to convert decimal to binary. If you enter an invalid input, the program will display an error message and terminate.
4. After selecting the operation, the program will prompt you to enter the value you want to convert.
5. Enter the value you wish to convert. It should be a positive integer.
6. The program will perform the conversion and display the result.
7. After displaying the result, the program will ask if you want to continue with another operation.
8. Enter 'y' to perform another conversion or 'n' to exit the program.
9. If you choose to continue, the program will return to step 2. If you choose to exit, the program will display a farewell message and terminate.

Please note that the program expects valid inputs, such as 'bd' or 'db' for the operation and a positive integer for the value to be converted.
